# Analysis of the Effect of COVID-19 Pandemic on India

## Introduction

This project aims to analyze the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on India and its various states. The analysis focuses on several key aspects, including active cases, deaths, vaccinations, and growth trends. The results are visualized using graphs to provide a clear and comprehensive understanding of the pandemic's effects.

## Objectives

* Identify the top 15 states with the most active COVID-19 cases.
* Identify the top 15 states with the most deaths due to COVID-19.
* Identify the top 15 states with the most vaccinations administered.
* Identify the top 15 states with the least vaccinations administered.
* Analyze gender-based vaccination data.
* Examine the growth trends of COVID-19 across different states.

## Data Sources

The data used for this analysis is obtained from credible sources, including government health departments and publicly available datasets related to COVID-19 in India.

## Technologies Used

* **Python**: The primary programming language used for analysis.
* **NumPy**: Used for numerical operations and data manipulation.
* **Pandas**: Used for data manipulation and analysis.

# **Analysis of the Effect of COVID-19 Pandemic on India**

## **Introduction**

This project aims to analyze the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on India and its various states. The analysis focuses on several key aspects, including active cases, deaths, vaccinations, and growth trends. The results are visualized using graphs to provide a clear and comprehensive understanding of the pandemic's effects.

## **Objectives**

* Identify the top 15 states with the most active COVID-19 cases.
* Identify the top 15 states with the most deaths due to COVID-19.
* Identify the top 15 states with the most vaccinations administered.
* Identify the top 15 states with the least vaccinations administered.
* Analyze gender-based vaccination data.
* Examine the growth trends of COVID-19 across different states.

## **Data Sources**

The data used for this analysis is obtained from credible sources, including government health departments and publicly available datasets related to COVID-19 in India.

## **Technologies Used**

* **Python**: The primary programming language used for analysis.
* **NumPy**: Used for numerical operations and data manipulation.
* **Pandas**: Used for data manipulation and analysis.
* **Matplotlib**: Used for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
* **Seaborn**: Used for making statistical graphics.

## Installation

   * Identifies and visualizes states with the highest number of active COVID-19 cases.
2. **Top 15 States with Most Deaths**:
   * Identifies and visualizes states with the highest number of deaths due to COVID-19.
3. **Top 15 States with Most Vaccinations**:
   * Identifies and visualizes states with the highest number of vaccinations administered.
4. **Top 15 States with Least Vaccinations**:
   * Identifies and visualizes states with the lowest number of vaccinations administered.
5. **Gender-Based Vaccination Analysis**:
   * Analyzes and visualizes vaccination data based on gender.
6. **COVID-19 Growth Trends**:
   * Analyzes and visualizes the growth trends of COVID-19 cases across different states over time.

## **Visualization Examples**
